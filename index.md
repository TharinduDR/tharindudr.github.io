I am a lecturer at the University of Wolverhampton and a member of the Research Group on Computational Linguistics (RGCL), affiliated with the Research Institute of Information and Language Processing (RIILP).

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Wolverhampton, which I defended in 2021. As a PhD student, I worked on applying deep learning-based text similarity metric for applications in translation technology under the supervision of [Prof Ruslan Mitkov](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/riilp---research-institute-in-information-and-lan/research-group-of-computational-linguistics/staff-at-rgcl/professor-mitkov/) and [Prof Constantin Orasan](http://pers-www.wlv.ac.uk/~in6093/). For my PhD, I first worked on semantic textual similarity methods and developed open-source tools such as [STS-Transformers](https://github.com/TharinduDR/STS-Transformers). Then I turned to use semantic textual similarity in Translation Memories. Finally, I worked on utilising semantic textual similarity in Translation Quality Estimation where I developed [TransQuest](http://tharindu.co.uk/TransQuest/) which won the WMT 2020 Shared Task on Translation Quality Estimation.

I have also worked on Offensive Language Identification, where I have contributed to developing new datasets such as OGDT (Offensive Greek Tweet Dataset) and MOLD (Marathi Offensive Language Dataset). Furthermore, I have developed tools such as [MUDES](https://github.com/TharinduDR/MUDES) to improve open-source development in offensive language detection.

I am interested in machine learning applications in NLP with a particular interest in multilingual models. Contact me if you would like to be part of exciting projects within my areas of expertise or are interested in exploring the use of those technologies to address real-world problems.
