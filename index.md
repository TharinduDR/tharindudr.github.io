I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computing and Communications](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc/), Lancaster University where I work with [UCREL NLP Group](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/), [Data Science Institute](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/dsi/) and [Security Lancaster](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/security-lancaster/). 

I received my PhD in Computer Science from University of Wolverhampton where I was affiliated with the Research Group in Computational Linguistics.

My research focuses on developing Machine Learning (ML) approaches for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, particularly emphasising NLP for Social Good. My work has various applications such as machine translation, social media analytics (i.e. hate speech detection, misinformation detection) and text adaptation. 

**Activities**
I served as an area chair in LREC-COLING 2024. I am in the programming committee of major NLP/ ML conferences. I served as the research: technical track chair in [EAMT 2023](https://events.tuni.fi/eamt23/). I am the programme committee co-chair in [NeTTT 2024](https://nettt-conference.com/). I have organised multiple shared tasks such as HASOC and MLSP.
